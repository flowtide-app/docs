By default, Vivaldi uses its own New Tab page. It also doesn't allow changing of the New Tab page by extensions by default. Because of that, you have to manually enable customization of the page.

To enable it, go to vivaldi:settings, go to the Tabs section, and turn on "Controlled by Extension" in Start Page \< New Tab Page.

After these steps, you should be good to go! Enjoy your new New Tab page!
